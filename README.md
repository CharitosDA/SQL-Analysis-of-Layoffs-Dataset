# SQL-Analysis-of-Layoffs-Dataset

Project Overview

In this project, I used SQL to look at and clean up data about layoffs at big companies. My goal was to find out when and where layoffs happened most.

What I Did

Cleaning the Data: I fixed errors in the data and filled in missing information so it was ready to use.
Using SQL Techniques: I connected different pieces of data with joins and used window functions to analyze the data in steps. This helped me see the bigger picture.
Finding Layoff Trends: I focused on finding the five biggest layoffs each year for every major company. This helped us understand which companies had the most layoffs.
Conclusion

This project helped show patterns in layoffs over time. It demonstrates how I can use SQL to sort through and analyze important data. This experience is a key part of my professional skills that I'm excited to share.
